# Notification System Frontend

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open the app in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoint

The frontend interacts with a backend API to send notifications and retrieve log history. The API endpoint is `http://localhost:8080`. Make sure the backend server is running before using the frontend application.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Axios (for API communication)
- HTML5/CSS3 (for styling)

## Future Improvements

- Enhance user interface and user experience
- Implement authentication and user management
- Add more notification types and categories
- Improve error handling and validation
- Implement unit tests for components and API calls
